# ProcessesPrefs

## This is just a demo

Sets the prefs for the [Processes App](https://github.com/sdsykes/Processes).

The build script installs this in ~/Library/PreferencePanes. So just build it on your machine and it should be ready to go.

In a real app you'd bundle it and install the pref pane when the app starts for the first time. TotalSpaces has code like that to install and update the plugin component.
